#UART
UART 2 is used(pin11,13), this could be configured from "/boot/armbianEnv.txt" via adding
`overlays= uart(1|2|3)`

Careful that uart0 is used as debug terminal by linux. 

#SPI
Add below to "/boot/armbianEnv.txt"
	overlay_prefix=sun8i-h3
	overlays=spi-spidev
	param_spidev_spi_bus=0
	param_spidev_max_freq=100000000

Load spidev by 
	`modprobe spidev`

spi should be listed under /dev/spi***
